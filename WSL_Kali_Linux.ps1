# Folks attempting to use Microsoft's instructions for installing Kali manually in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL or WSL2) will currently run
# into this issue. The Kali distribution linked on that page is 2019.2, so the signatures are already outdated as soon as it's installed.
# The other answers here look to be outdated at this point, referencing older keyring packages. At this time, the correct update
# package/process is:
wget https://http.kali.org/kali/pool/main/k/kali-archive-keyring/kali-archive-keyring_2020.2_all.deb # If This download WON'T work, then
# manually go to this page [https://http.kali.org/kali/pool/main/k/kali-archive-keyring/kali-archive-keyring_2020.2_all.deb]and download it, and then install it using this command:
dpkg -i kali-archive-keyring_2022.1_all.deb

wsl -l -v

wsl -l -o

wsl --list

wsl --setdefault docker-desktop

# Delete a WSL image
wsl --unregister kali-linux
wsl --terminate kali-linux
wsl -d kali-linux
